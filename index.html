Project Description: I will focus on creating neural network (NNs) that is able to accurately detect breast cancer from tissue images. There are many publicly available datasets of tissue images available online. Each pixel in the tissue image will be classified as "nucleus", "boundary", or "not nucleus and not boundary". After this classification, the neural network will then create a black and white image of only the nuclei. 

After segmenting the nuclei, features need to be computed. I envision using features like the nuclei's shape, area, and perimter. Nuclei in tissue images of an invasive breast cancer lesion will be larger and more distorted than nuclei in normal tissue images. By computing these features, the neural network will be able to predict when a tissue image is normal or when it shows the presence of a breast cancer lesion. 

The main goal of this project is to create a tool that helps doctors during their diagnoses. 


Project Goals
Create a neural network that segments each pixel into nucleus, boundary, or not nucleus and not boundary.
Compute various features.
Train the NN to be able to detect invasive vs. benign breast cancer lesions by looking at tissue images.
